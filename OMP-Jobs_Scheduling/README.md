To run, in Terminal:
1. Run `make clean`.
2. Run `make all`.
3. Run `./lab5-primes -e x -t y -c z` to find the number of primes between 3 and x, using y threads, and with chunk size of z.
4. Run `./lab5-curve -a x -b y -n w -t k -c z`, where x, y, z, and w are integers, to find the integral of the function f from x to y using trap rule and w trapezoids, paralleling with k threads and chunk size of z.
